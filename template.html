    <h2>Things im good at</h2>
    <p> I was on the Mounten Bike team for 5 years, and I was pretty good at it. I made a lot of frends there, another thing im good at is making frends. I am a pretty funny guy once you get to know me, so its easy for me to make frends. I did quit the MTB team after my fith year to do another sport that I want to persu, I started weightlifting. I have now been able to build up a lot of strength, especially for my size</p>

    <h2>My favorite Bible Verse</h2>
    <p>One of my favorites is corinthians 13:13 "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love" Many people like to think love is a curse, or somthing we should fear, even though its far from the truth. Another one I like is Joel 2:12-13, which says: “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.” it always reminds me that I dont need to hide anything from the lord. hurting is not somthing is not somthing we should fear, because through hurting I found the lord. </p>
