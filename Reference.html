  <h2>Reference 1</h2>
    <p>Here I have my reference, he was a MTB coach when I was on the team. The number is 270-252-8890, his name is Dwayne. He was a friend of my dad and has helped him rase me and I am verry greatfull, here is what he had to say. "That boy is verry stubborn sometimes, when he was a little boy he would just stay on his ipad but now he's grown into a man. He does a lot of sports and is a hard worker when you give him the right motivation"    </p>
